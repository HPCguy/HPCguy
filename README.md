- 👋 Hi, I’m @HPCguy
- 👀 I’m interested in High Peformance Computing.  I sat on several physics application teams in my 20 year career and I'm an expert at parallel efficiency. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning write a compiler.  I know what features are missing in HPC languages and compilers, but have no experience writing a compiler.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a new language for HPC efficiency.  Almost every parallel language has been written by academics, not app developers. That has been a mistake.
- 📫 Leave an issue in one of my (soon to be posted) repositories if you would like to contact me.  I need help from experienced language developers!
